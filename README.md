## Video2excel

Original idea was shamelessly stolen from this repo, but has been expanded a bit to add additional functionality - https://github.com/takacs/pixel-spreadsheet

## How to use:
1. Get a video and configure splitvid.py to turn it into a set of images.
2. Set up image2excel.py to turn the set of images into a set of spreadsheets.
3. Run render_excel.py to turn the set of spreadsheets into a set of excel screenshots.
4. Run images2gif.py to turn the spreadsheet screenshots into a gif.

## To do:
 - Streamline use a bit
 - Add some more config options for the spreadsheet rendering (things like saturation, brightness, maybe a greyscale option)
 - Find a way to make the excel window look better (classic excel anyone?)
